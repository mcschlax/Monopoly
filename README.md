# Developer's Note:
Hight Senior Design Project for the International Baccalaureate Computer Science HL 2.
Contains a compressed folder full of the documentation and production process.

Don't forget the default folder full of config files, also, as long as the config format is 
uphold. You can easily change the values within to make the game personalized; including all
the pictures used.

I am personally pleased with almost every aspect of this project.
The only thing I am displeased with is the aweful popup input system. The infrastructure for a 
decent input system exists, however since at the time I did not know threading existed, the nice 
input was never implemented.
